Try using validation set on model -->Kuntal
Identify new classes of fruits and vegetables and download data for the same close to 30fruits and 30 veggies

Option 1:
	Append new images to existing dataset such that each class now has ~1k images for training
	Code to make all category data same ready

Option 2:
	Use existing images to augment the same to generate equal no of images at end
	Augmentaion Code needs to be explored

Option 3:
	Use the existing dataset but on different models and sees it working for same no of epochs.


Retrain again and see performance

We already have one model giving close to 76%accuracy save that and try intergating
Simulatenously work on the app to show some models working


Work done so far:
	Get necessary images from skanda and vijay
	Change directory structure as fruits and vegetables
	Tried Uploading entire dataset on drive to work on Colab(Failed multiple tries with unzip,Folder upload..)
	Explored about Mobilenet v2
	Implemented MobilenetV2 on local system for 5 and 10 epochs giving accuracy of(68-77)
	Retrained with metric changed to sparse_categorical_accuracy and different Optimizer
		Sparse_categorical_accuracy(68% for 1 epoch)
		normal_accurcay(49.12 for 1 epoch)
	Ran all this on local system using CPU which took a lot of time for each epoch
	Tried customized model a simpler version to see the working obtained accuracy of ~49% for 2 epochs
	Retried uploading all images to drive from other laptop
	Started exploring on using bing_images_download,simple_images_download to extract images 
	Came across Selenium and Beautifulsoup to extract images from google images and create dataset of needed size
	Faced Problems with using .screnshot as resolution changed or modified code to use original resolution images.
	Fixed or debugged the changes to get desired number of images.
	Git Issues fixed by creating branches
