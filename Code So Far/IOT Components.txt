1) Firsly we need to figure a way to attach a base and the top of the weighing scale to the load cell
2) A tool to peel the protective film around a wire.
3) Jumper wire cable i.e connect the red white green black wires to pins to make its working easier. --> Crimp pins
4) connector housing for those jumper wires
5) Verify the resistance between opposite pairs and it has to be above 1000 ohms
	any other pair makes it between 750-850
	So we might need an Multimeter
6) Battery to power up aurdino
7) Usb to arduino connector
8) battery to arduino connector
9) Connect the pins to pins of amplifier and make it have connectors housing
